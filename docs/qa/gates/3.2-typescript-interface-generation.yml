nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Interface generation is code transformation only. No external dependencies with vulnerabilities. Proper handling of unknown types."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance: ~4ms for 23 test scenarios, well under <1s target for 200 schemas. Linear O(n) complexity with efficient Set-based deduplication."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for edge cases. Unknown types default to 'unknown' (safer than 'any'). Robust composition handling."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with excellent separation of concerns. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation. TypeScript strict mode compliance. Well-tested (94.62% coverage)."
