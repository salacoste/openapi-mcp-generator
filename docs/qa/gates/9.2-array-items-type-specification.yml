    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities. Depth limits prevent DoS. Type safety maintained. No information disclosure. Circular reference detection prevents infinite loops."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "O(n) time complexity, O(10) space complexity. <200ms for 40 tools. Zero performance regression. Efficient Set-based circular detection."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks. Depth limit prevents stack overflow. Circular reference detection prevents infinite loops. All edge cases tested."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
