  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security implications. Type safety improvements enhance robustness against runtime errors."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No runtime performance impact. Type-only changes have zero performance cost."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Reliability significantly improved through compile-time type checking. Eliminates entire class of potential runtime errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent improvement. Single source of truth for types eliminates 30 lines of duplicate code. Future maintenance simplified."

# Key Achievements
achievements:
  - "99.38% type coverage achieved (target: 95%)"
  - "Eliminated all `as any` workarounds in production code"
  - "Reduced code duplication by 30 lines"
  - "Single source of truth for type definitions established"
  - "CI enforcement configured to prevent regression"
