# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling without data leakage. Debug logging excludes sensitive data. HTTPS-ready. Timeout protection. Retry loop prevention with 30s cap."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Client initialization <50ms. Axios instance reuse. Configurable timeouts (default 30s). Exponential backoff with cap prevents resource exhaustion."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling (ApiError with context). Retry logic for 5xx and network errors. Network error detection. Graceful degradation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure. Well-documented with JSDoc. TypeScript strict mode. Extensible design with interceptors."
