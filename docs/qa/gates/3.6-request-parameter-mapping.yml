# Notes for development team
notes: |
  STRONG IMPLEMENTATION overall with excellent foundations. The core parameter mapping logic
  is solid and well-tested (98.82% coverage). However, AC11 (array serialization) is a
  CRITICAL GAP that must be addressed before marking this story as DONE.

  The team made an undocumented assumption that axios will handle array serialization,
  but OpenAPI specs define explicit 'style' and 'explode' parameters that must be honored.

  RECOMMENDATION: Fix AC11 (array serialization) and add performance benchmarks, then
  this story will be ready for PASS status. The other issues (JSON parsing, dates, enums)
  can be addressed in follow-up stories as they are less critical for MVP.

  POSITIVE: Test suite quality is exceptional. The team clearly understands the domain
  and has written comprehensive, well-organized tests. Once the array serialization
  issue is resolved, this will be production-ready code.
