# Notes for development team
notes: |
  SOLID FOUNDATION for response processing with excellent type casting and error handling.
  The core implementation is clean and well-tested (89.55% coverage), but misses several
  important features that impact production readiness.

  CRITICAL GAPS (P0):
  1. AC7 (null/undefined handling) - Data integrity issue
  2. AC8 (array truncation) - Performance/context size issue

  The implementation correctly prioritizes:
  ✅ Type safety via TypeScript interfaces
  ✅ MCP protocol compliance
  ✅ Error handling with context
  ✅ Response schema lookup

  But defers:
  ❌ Schema validation (AC9) - Would catch API spec mismatches
  ❌ Response metadata (AC11) - Useful for debugging
  ❌ Content-type handling (AC6) - Assumes JSON everywhere
  ❌ Array truncation (AC8) - Could cause Claude context overflow

  RECOMMENDATION: Address AC7 and AC8 (7 hours total) to reach PASS status. AC9 and AC11
  are valuable but can be deferred to post-MVP or follow-up stories.

  INTEGRATION QUALITY: Excellent integration with parameter-mapper via wrapWithErrorHandling.
  The two modules work together seamlessly to produce complete execute functions.

  CODE QUALITY: Very high. Clean separation of concerns, good naming, comprehensive tests.
  The uncovered lines (124-134) are tested via integration in parameter-mapper tests.
