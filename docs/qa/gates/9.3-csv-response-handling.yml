# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Code generation only with no runtime user input exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "<1ms per operation (verified by benchmark test). O(n) complexity is optimal."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful fallback to JSON for unknown types. Null-safe checks throughout. Backward compatible."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear code structure, JSDoc comments, follows project patterns. Easy to extend."
