# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities. Proper depth limits prevent DoS, circular ref detection prevents infinite loops, no code injection risks, no hardcoded secrets."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Max depth limit (10), O(1) circular ref detection with Set, early error returns with fallback. Performance benchmarks show excellent results."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive test coverage validates edge cases. Fallback behavior tested. Circular refs, deep nesting, and missing schemas all handled gracefully."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns. Debug library properly integrated. All coding standards met."

# Compliance summary

# Strengths noted during review
strengths:
  - "Comprehensive test coverage - 13 new tests covering all edge cases"
  - "Clean separation of concerns with 4 well-designed helper functions"
  - "Proper error handling with graceful fallbacks to generic objects"
  - "Circular reference detection using Set-based tracking (O(1) lookup)"
  - "Max depth protection (10 levels) prevents infinite recursion"
  - "Type safety maintained throughout - no any types introduced"
  - "Backward compatibility preserved - all existing tests pass"
  - "Build succeeds, TypeScript compilation passes without errors"
  - "Debug library properly integrated with structured logging"
