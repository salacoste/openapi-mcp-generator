    notes: "No security implications. Configuration-only changes."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Adds approximately 2 seconds to CI pipeline for type coverage check. Acceptable overhead for quality enforcement."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent reliability improvement. CI enforcement prevents type safety regression across 9 matrix combinations (3 Node versions × 3 OS platforms)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent maintainability. Clear npm scripts, documented CI workflow, automated enforcement prevents manual checks."
