deferral_validation:
  deferral_approved: true
  deferral_date: "2025-01-08"
  target_completion: "Q1 2025"
  deferral_reasons:
    - "Not blocking Epic 6 functionality"
    - "30 documentation files require updates (150% higher effort than estimated)"
    - "Low ROI relative to Epic 6 type safety priorities"
    - "Template may retain historical reference value"
    - "Scope management for Epic 6 focus"

  current_state:
    cli_usage_removed: true  # Completed in Story 5.1
    directory_exists: true  # packages/templates/hello-world/
    documentation_references: 30  # Claimed, not exhaustively verified
    estimated_effort: "4-5 hours"
    repository_impact: "~2KB, 31 files"

  pre_work_required:
    - "Confirm exact scope (verify 30 file count)"
    - "Create detailed file-by-file remediation plan"
    - "Re-estimate effort accurately"
    - "Get stakeholder approval to proceed"

  risks_of_deferral:
    severity: low
    impact:
      - "Minor confusion for new contributors seeing obsolete template"
      - "Documentation slightly out of sync with current implementation"
      - "Small repository size increase (~2KB)"
    mitigation:
      - "Template clearly marked as deprecated in README"
      - "Story 5.1 removed all production usage"
      - "No functional impact on generated servers"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security impact. Template not used in production."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No performance impact. Repository size negligibly affected."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No reliability impact. Template not in execution path."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Minor maintainability concern from obsolete code and documentation. Acceptable for deferral until Q1 2025."

# Deferral Decision Audit Trail

  original_priority: P3  # Low - Cleanup
  original_estimate: "3 story points (2 hours)"
  revised_estimate: "4-5 hours (150% increase from 30 doc files discovery)"
  epic_priorities:
    - "P0: Story 6.1 (Type Definition Mismatch)"
    - "P1: Story 6.2 (Type Coverage Target)"
    - "P3: Story 6.3 (Hello-World Cleanup) ‚Üê Deferred"
  decision_rationale: "Epic 6 focused on type safety. Documentation-heavy cleanup deferred to maintain sprint velocity and focus."
  alternative_considered: "Complete in Epic 6"
  alternative_rejected_reason: "Would add 4-5 hours to Epic 6, diluting focus on critical type safety work"
