- ‚úÖ Story 6.2: Achieved 99.38% type coverage (Target: 95%)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Story 6.3: Hello-world cleanup (Deferred to Q1 2025)

**Total Development Time**: ~2 hours (Estimated: 5-7 hours)
**Code Changes**: 2 source files, 2 configuration files
**No Breaking Changes**: All changes are type-safety improvements

---

## üéØ Testing Scope

### Story 6.1: Fix Type Definition Mismatch

**What Changed**:
- Removed duplicate `NormalizedSchema` type definition (30 lines)
- Added imports from `@openapi-to-mcp/parser`
- Removed `as any` type cast workaround
- Updated composition handling logic

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/generator/src/interface-generator.ts` (138 lines)
- `packages/generator/src/mcp-generator.ts` (3 lines)

**Test Focus**:
1. **TypeScript Compilation**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/generator
   pnpm tsc --noEmit
   # Expected: SUCCESS (no errors)
   ```

2. **Package Build**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/generator
   pnpm build
   # Expected: SUCCESS
   ```

3. **Generated Code Unchanged**:
   ```bash
   # Verify generated TypeScript interfaces are identical
   pnpm cli generate ./examples/petstore/openapi.json --output /tmp/test-gen
   # Check: src/types.ts should have valid interfaces
   ```

---

### Story 6.2: Achieve 95% Type Coverage Target

**What Changed**:
- Installed `type-coverage` tool (v2.29.7)
- Added CI enforcement to GitHub Actions
- Added npm scripts for type checking and coverage

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` (added type coverage check)
- `package.json` (added 4 scripts)

**Test Focus**:
1. **Type Coverage Measurement**:
   ```bash
   pnpm type-coverage
   # Expected: 99.38% (35,631 / 35,852)
   # Expected: "type-coverage success"
   ```

2. **Type Coverage Enforcement**:
   ```bash
   pnpm type-coverage --at-least 95
   # Expected: EXIT 0 (success)
   ```

3. **Quality Gate Script**:
   ```bash
   pnpm quality
   # Expected: Runs lint + type-check + type-coverage
   # Note: May have pre-existing test errors (not blocking)
   ```

4. **Per-Package Coverage**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/parser && pnpm type-coverage
   # Expected: 99.91%

   cd packages/cli && pnpm type-coverage
   # Expected: 99.69%

   cd packages/generator && pnpm type-coverage
   # Expected: 99.11%
   ```

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Checklist

### Story 6.1: Fix Type Definition Mismatch

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes (`pnpm tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] All packages build successfully (`pnpm build`)
- [ ] Zero `any` types in modified source files
- [ ] No ESLint errors in production code

**Functionality**:
- [ ] Generated TypeScript interfaces are valid
- [ ] Interface generation produces same output as before
- [ ] No runtime errors in generated code
- [ ] CLI still generates valid MCP servers

**Type Safety**:
- [ ] `as any` workaround removed from mcp-generator.ts:74
- [ ] Duplicate `NormalizedSchema` removed from interface-generator.ts
- [ ] Parser types imported correctly
- [ ] Type narrowing works correctly ('nullable' in schema)

---

### Story 6.2: Achieve 95% Type Coverage Target

**Type Coverage**:
- [ ] Overall coverage ‚â•95% (Currently: 99.38%)
- [ ] Parser package ‚â•95% (Currently: 99.91%)
- [ ] CLI package ‚â•95% (Currently: 99.69%)
- [ ] Generator package ‚â•95% (Currently: 99.11%)

**CI/CD**:
- [ ] Type coverage check runs in GitHub Actions
- [ ] CI fails if coverage drops below 95%
- [ ] All CI checks pass on main branch
- [ ] PR workflow includes type coverage check

**Scripts**:
- [ ] `pnpm type-check` runs TypeScript compilation
- [ ] `pnpm type-coverage` enforces 95% threshold
- [ ] `pnpm type-coverage:detail` shows detailed report
- [ ] `pnpm quality` runs all quality checks

## üß™ Test Plan

### Smoke Tests (Priority 1)

1. **Build Verification**:
   ```bash
   pnpm clean
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   # Expected: All packages build successfully
   ```

2. **Type Coverage Baseline**:
   ```bash
   pnpm type-coverage
   # Expected: 99.38% or higher
   ```

3. **CLI Integration**:
   ```bash
   pnpm cli generate ./examples/petstore/openapi.json --output /tmp/qa-test
   cd /tmp/qa-test
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Expected: Generated server builds successfully
   ```

---

### Regression Tests (Priority 2)

1. **TypeScript Compilation**:
   ```bash
   pnpm tsc --noEmit
   # Expected: No compilation errors in production code
   # Note: Test files may have pre-existing errors (not blocking)
   ```

2. **Linting**:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   # Expected: No errors in production code (src/ directories)
   ```

3. **Generated Code Comparison**:
   ```bash
   # Compare before/after generated output
   # Expected: Identical TypeScript interfaces
   # Expected: No behavioral changes
   ```

---

### Edge Cases (Priority 3)

1. **Type Coverage Boundary**:
   ```bash
   # Temporarily lower threshold to test enforcement
   pnpm type-coverage --at-least 100
   # Expected: FAIL (coverage is 99.38%, not 100%)

   pnpm type-coverage --at-least 90
   # Expected: PASS (coverage 99.38% > 90%)
   ```

2. **Complex Schema Handling**:
   - Test with APIs that have composition (allOf/oneOf/anyOf)
   - Test with nested objects
   - Test with nullable types
   - Test with enum types

3. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Invalid OpenAPI spec still produces clear error
   - Type mismatches caught by TypeScript
   - Build failures reported correctly

## üö® Known Issues & Limitations

### Pre-Existing Test Errors

**Status**: Not introduced by Epic 6 work

**Details**:
- Some integration tests have TypeScript errors in `__tests__/` directories
- These errors existed before Epic 6 changes
- Production code (src/) compiles successfully
- Type coverage measurement excludes test files

**Examples**:
```
packages/generator/__tests__/interface-generator.test.ts:24:19
packages/generator/__tests__/integration/authentication-integration.test.ts:62:7
packages/parser/__tests__/tag-extractor.test.ts:200:14
```

**Impact**:
- No impact on production code or generated output
- Does not affect type coverage measurements
- Recommended: Address in separate test infrastructure story

**Verification**:
```bash
# Production code compiles successfully
pnpm tsc --noEmit src/**/*.ts
# Expected: No errors

# Type coverage is high
pnpm type-coverage
# Expected: 99.38%
```

### Story 6.3 Deferred

**Status**: Intentionally deferred to Q1 2025

**Reason**:
- Hello-world template cleanup is low priority
- 30 documentation files need updates
- No functional impact
- Focus on higher-priority type safety work

**What's NOT Removed Yet**:
- `packages/templates/hello-world (removed Story 6.3)/` directory still exists
- 30 documentation files still reference hello-world
- Template not used by CLI (removed in Story 5.1)

**Impact**:
- No functional impact (template not used)
- May confuse new contributors
- Scheduled for Q1 2025 cleanup
