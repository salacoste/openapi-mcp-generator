# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-10-04
Reviewer: Quinn
Story: Project Repository Setup and Monorepo Structure

## Summary

- **Reliability**: PASS - Infrastructure setup provides solid foundation for failure prevention
- **Usability**: CONCERNS - Developer experience could be enhanced with additional tooling

## Assessment Details

### Reliability: PASS

**Evidence:**
- Git repository initialization with proper `.gitignore` prevents accidental secret commits
- pnpm workspaces provide strict dependency resolution preventing phantom dependencies
- TypeScript strict mode catches type errors at compile time (prevents 90% of runtime bugs per tech stack doc)
- ESLint with security plugin (`eslint-plugin-security`) provides SAST scanning
- Exact version pinning (no `^` or `~`) ensures reproducible builds
- Husky pre-commit hooks prevent bad code from being committed

**Validation Points:**
- ✅ Error prevention through TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Automated quality gates (linting, formatting) via git hooks
- ✅ Dependency stability through exact version pinning
- ✅ Security scanning integrated into linting workflow

**Notes:**
- Infrastructure choices demonstrate strong reliability engineering principles
- Automated validation prevents manual errors
- Foundation supports graceful degradation through modular package structure

### Usability: CONCERNS

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Clear README with setup instructions
- ✅ Single-command installation (`pnpm install`)
- ✅ Consistent scripts across all packages (`test`, `build`, `lint`, `format`)
- ⚠️ No developer onboarding documentation beyond basic README
- ⚠️ No contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- ⚠️ No troubleshooting guide for common setup issues

**Validation Points:**
- ✅ Learnability: README provides basic setup path
- ⚠️ Operability: Missing advanced workflow documentation
- ⚠️ Error recoverability: No troubleshooting guidance

**Notes:**
- Basic developer experience is functional but minimal
- More experienced developers will manage fine, but newcomers may struggle
- Foundation is solid; documentation can be enhanced in Story 1.8

## Critical Issues

None identified - this is infrastructure setup with appropriate quality measures.

## Recommendations for Enhancement

### High Priority (Consider for Story 1.8)

1. **Developer Onboarding Guide** (Usability)
   - **Risk**: New contributors face friction during setup
   - **Fix**: Create `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` with detailed onboarding workflow
   - **Effort**: ~2 hours
   - **Impact**: Significantly improves contributor experience

2. **Troubleshooting Documentation** (Usability)
   - **Risk**: Common setup issues not documented
   - **Fix**: Add troubleshooting section to README with common errors (pnpm version mismatch, Node.js version issues, workspace linking problems)
   - **Effort**: ~1 hour
   - **Impact**: Reduces support burden

### Medium Priority

3. **Setup Validation Script** (Usability)
   - **Risk**: Developers may not realize their environment is misconfigured
   - **Fix**: Create `scripts/validate-setup.sh` to check Node.js/pnpm versions, workspace links
   - **Effort**: ~1.5 hours
   - **Impact**: Proactive error detection

## Quick Wins

- Add troubleshooting section to README: ~30 minutes
- Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` stub with basic workflow: ~30 minutes

## NFR Quality Score

### Calculation
```
Base: 100
- Usability CONCERNS: -10
Final Score: 90/100
```

### Assessment
**Overall: PASS** - Infrastructure foundation is solid with strong reliability characteristics. Usability concerns are minor and can be addressed in documentation story (1.8).

## Gate Integration

```yaml
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [reliability, usability]
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Strong foundation: strict dependencies, type safety, automated validation, security scanning'
  usability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Basic developer experience functional but minimal documentation; recommend enhancing in Story 1.8'
```

**Next Steps:**
- For QA gate decision, run: `*gate 1.1`
- Consider addressing usability concerns in Story 1.8 (Dev Documentation)
