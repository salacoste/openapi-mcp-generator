# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## 3.1 Overall UX Vision

**Command-Line Experience:**
- Zero-configuration quick start: single command generates working MCP server
- Progressive disclosure: simple commands for beginners, advanced flags for power users
- Excellent error recovery: helpful error messages guide users to solutions
- Self-documenting: `--help` provides clear usage examples and flag descriptions

**Generated Output Experience:**
- Generated `README.md` provides copy-paste setup instructions
- Clear file structure matches Node.js conventions
- Generated code includes inline comments explaining key sections
- `.env.example` clearly documents all required environment variables

## 3.2 Key Interaction Paradigms

**CLI Workflow:**
1. **Discovery:** User finds tool via npm or GitHub
2. **Quick Start:** `npx openapi-to-mcp generate <swagger-file>`
3. **Configuration:** Tool detects auth schemes, prompts for missing info
4. **Generation:** Real-time progress indicators during parsing/generation
5. **Validation:** Auto-check generated code compiles, show success/errors
6. **Next Steps:** Display clear instructions for MCP server installation

**Error Handling Paradigm:**
- Errors show *what failed*, *why it failed*, and *how to fix it*
- Validation errors point to specific OpenAPI lines/sections
- Network errors (external `$ref`) suggest offline mode or manual resolution

## 3.3 Core Screens and Views

**N/A for CLI** - Instead, key **CLI output views**:

1. **Help Screen** (`--help`) - Command syntax, examples, flag reference
2. **Generation Progress** - Spinner/progress bar during parsing and code generation
3. **Success Summary** - Files created, next steps, example usage
4. **Error Report** - Structured error output with actionable fixes
5. **Verbose Log** (`--verbose`) - Detailed diagnostic information for debugging

## 3.4 Accessibility

**N/A (Command-Line Tool)** - However, terminal accessibility considerations:
- ANSI color codes with `--no-color` flag for screen readers
- Clear text output that works with terminal readers
- Progress indicators that don't spam output (single-line updates)

## 3.5 Branding

**Minimal CLI Aesthetic:**
- Clean, professional terminal output (avoid ASCII art clutter)
- Consistent color scheme: green for success, yellow for warnings, red for errors
- Brand name displayed in help/version output
- Generated code comments include attribution (`Generated by openapi-to-mcp`)

**Open Source Identity:**
- GitHub repository as primary brand touchpoint
- Documentation site (GitHub Pages) with clean, developer-focused design
- Community-first language in all messaging

## 3.6 Target Device and Platforms

**Development Environments:**
- macOS Terminal, iTerm2, Warp
- Linux terminals (bash, zsh, fish shells)
- Windows: WSL2, PowerShell, Git Bash, Windows Terminal

**Distribution:**
- npm registry (primary): `npx openapi-to-mcp`
- GitHub releases (secondary): downloadable binaries for offline use
- Homebrew (future): `brew install openapi-to-mcp`

**Terminal Compatibility:**
- UTF-8 support for spinners/progress indicators
- Graceful degradation for limited terminals (no color, no Unicode)
- Standard streams: stdout for output, stderr for errors, stdin for prompts
