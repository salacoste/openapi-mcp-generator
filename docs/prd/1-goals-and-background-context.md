# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

- Generate production-ready MCP servers from OpenAPI 3.0 specifications in <10 minutes
- Enable AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT) to interact with any REST API through automated MCP integration
- Reduce manual MCP server development time from 20-40 hours to <30 seconds
- Support smart method filtering to prevent AI context window overflow for APIs with 200+ methods
- Provide AI-optimized response formatting for improved comprehension and usability
- Achieve 85%+ generation success rate with zero-error TypeScript compilation
- Build open-source tool with 500 MAU within 3 months and strong community adoption

## 1.2 Background Context

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI assistants to interact with external systems, but manually creating MCP servers for each API requires deep technical knowledge and 20-40 hours of work per API. This bottleneck prevents widespread AI-API integration, especially for the "long tail" of internal and niche APIs.

OpenAPI-to-MCP Generator solves this through automated code generation: a single CLI command transforms any OpenAPI 3.0 document into a fully functional TypeScript MCP server. The tool differentiates through AI-first architecture—semantic method organization, smart context filtering, and optimized response formatting—enabling AI to effectively work with APIs containing 200+ methods. Built through iterative validation on production-grade APIs (starting with Ozon Performance API's 300+ methods), the generator targets AI power users and enterprise teams seeking rapid, standardized API-to-AI integration.
