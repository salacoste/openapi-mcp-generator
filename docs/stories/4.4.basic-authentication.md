# Story 4.4: Basic Authentication Handler - Brownfield Addition

**Epic:** Epic 4: Authentication & Security Handlers

---

## User Story

**As a** generated MCP server,
**I want** to add Basic Authentication to requests,
**So that** I can access APIs that require username/password auth.

---

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: HTTP client (3.3), configuration (4.1), auth pattern from Stories 4.2-4.3
- Technology: HTTP Basic Auth, base64 encoding, Axios interceptors
- Follows pattern: Request interceptor pattern from Stories 4.2-4.3
- Touch points: HTTP client initialization, configuration loading

**Epic Context:**
Implements HTTP Basic Authentication following the established auth handler pattern. Encodes username:password in base64 and adds to Authorization header.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Basic Auth Module:** Create `auth/basic.ts.hbs` with `addBasicAuth()` function
2. **Authorization Header:** Format `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>`
3. **Base64 Encoding:** Properly encode `username:password` credentials
4. **Configuration:** Load from `config.basicAuth.username` and `config.basicAuth.password`
5. **Validation:** Check both username and password present
6. **Interceptor:** Register with HTTP client during initialization
7. **Error Handling:** Clear errors for missing credentials
8. **Security:** Never log username or password values
9. **Character Encoding:** Handle UTF-8 special characters correctly
10. **Template Generation:** Generate code when `type: http, scheme: basic` in OpenAPI

### Integration Requirements

11. **OpenAPI Detection:** Parse `type: http, scheme: basic` from security schemes
12. **HTTP Client:** Register interceptor, compatible with API Key and Bearer auth
13. **Configuration:** Use Story 4.1 config system for credentials

### Quality Requirements

14. **Testing:** Base64 encoding, multi-auth, missing credentials, no logging (≥80% coverage)
15. **Documentation:** README section on Basic Auth, .env.example updates
16. **Code Quality:** TypeScript strict mode, clear errors, <5ms latency

---

## Technical Notes

```typescript
// auth/basic.ts.hbs
export function addBasicAuth(
  config: InternalAxiosRequestConfig,
  serverConfig: ServerConfig
): InternalAxiosRequestConfig {
  const { username, password } = serverConfig.basicAuth || {};

  if (!username || !password) {
    throw new Error(
      'Basic Authentication required. Set BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD in .env'
    );
  }

  const credentials = Buffer.from(`${username}:${password}`, 'utf-8').toString('base64');
  config.headers['Authorization'] = `Basic ${credentials}`;

  return config;
}
```
